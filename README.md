# Machine Failure Predictive Analysis
The project deals with predicting the failure of machine prior to its breakdown ,inorder to save the breakdown time and production loss.

## Business Problem

 
-The xyz manufacturing company has provided us the dataset as records of different parameters while working on different types of products for one of its substractive manufacturing machine like drill,shaper or lathe.The dataset has records like surrounding air temp assuming it might be air cooled machine,the process temperature,rotational speed of the motor driving the tool,the torque induced and the tool wear rate.By this records the company wants to predict the failure of machine prior enough to avoid the breakdown of machine,production loss and batch production loss.The predictions will help the company to decide the action of maintenance on respective machine priorly on basis of prediction.



## Approach

-In order to predict the machine failures we are building a model which would train on previous records of failures with other recorded parameters ,which will predict whether the machine is prone to fail on the running parameters or not.
